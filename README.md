# Project Title: TMDB Movie and TV Show Search

# Description:

This project was initiated during my early journey into Python coding, specifically as an educational exploration of APIs. Leveraging the API provided by The Movie Database (TMDB), a comprehensive platform for movie and TV show information, this project serves as a practical showcase of API integration.

# Key Features:

Search Functionality: The project enables users to search for movies and TV shows by name or similar keywords.
Tkinter GUI: The application boasts a user-friendly Tkinter graphical user interface, making it accessible and interactive.
Detailed Information: Upon performing a search, the application retrieves and displays detailed information about the movies and TV shows found, including ratings, descriptions, and more.
Project Status:

Initially developed in 2020, this project may require updates due to potential changes in TMDB's API documentation. Please note that as of my last my last knowledge update in September 2023, it's important to acknowledge that the code may not be aligned with the most current TMDB API version. Since my last check, there might have been updates, changes, or improvements to TMDB's API that could potentially affect the functionality of the project.

# Future Plans (As of September 2023):

To address this issue, I plan to revisit the project and make the necessary adjustments to ensure compatibility with the latest TMDB API version. The aim is to provide users with a seamless movie and TV show search experience while keeping up with any changes TMDB has made to its API documentation.
